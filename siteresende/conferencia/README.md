# (DEPRECATED) Daily CSS grid layout demo 

This demo illustrated how to build a video call using Daily and CSS grid layout. 

We'll be deprecating support for this demo at the end of 2020, because building on top of the Daily Call Object API, like we do in the [React demo](https://github.com/daily-co/daily-demos/tree/master/react-demo), better meets the needs of an entirely custom call interface.
